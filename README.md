# Object Detection with Pre-trained SOTA Models

This project aims to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained object detection models—YOLOv7, DETR, and SSD—on a given set of images. Each model will be tested, and the results will be compared to understand their strengths and limitations.
