# Object Detection with Pre-trained SOTA Models

This project aims to evaluate the performance of state-of-the-art (SOTA) pre-trained object detection models—YOLOv7, DETR, and SSD—on a given set of images. Each model will be tested, and the results will be compared to understand their strengths and limitations.

## Models Used

- **YOLOv7**: Known for its speed and accuracy, YOLOv7 is a real-time object detection model.
- **DETR**: Detection Transformer (DETR) uses transformers for object detection, providing high accuracy and a unique approach compared to traditional CNN models.
- **SSD**: Single Shot Multibox Detector (SSD) is efficient for real-time applications, balancing accuracy and speed.

## Project Goals

The goal of this project is to:
1. Test each model on the same set of images.
2. Analyze and compare the results to understand each model's detection capabilities.
3. Identify potential use cases for each model based on performance characteristics.
